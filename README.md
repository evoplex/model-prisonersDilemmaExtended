# Extended Prisoner's Dilemma Game

This is a model plugin for [Evoplex](https://evoplex.org).

It implements a generalized version of the spatial prisoner's dilemma game proposed by Nowak & May (1992) [1]. In this version, all payoffs can be varied, not only the "temptation to defect".

Please, see the [parent repo](https://github.com/evoplex/model-prisonersDilemma) for more details.
